  description: |
    CLustering tendency is always an important issue for the community. Kleinberg states that it is impossible to design a clustering algorithm that
    satisfiy three conditions. To detect whether a dataset has a cluster structure or 
    is clusterable, we have to 

    Hierarchical clustering is a popular clustering algorithm since it can give the
    users an hierarchical relation between different observations, and could let users
    to choose how many clusters current dataset should have. Such algorithms, especially
    the linkage based clustering algorithms, are widely used in many domains such as 
    biology, manufacturing and psychology. However, the time complexity is the main 
    drawback of hierarchical clustering algorithms. 

    This work is a practical development of the techniques that used in the above
    project. Currently We proved that a min-max ultrametric matrix operation on arbitray 
    distance matrix could finally converged in to an ultrametric matrix. We also proved 
    that such matrix is identical to the cophnetic distance matrix from single linkage 
    hierarchical clustering algorithm. The natural of matrix-like operation intrigues 
    us to utilize GPU to accelerate the process of calculate hierarchical clustering. 
    Moreover, such GPU enhanced algorithm could also assist on the speed of clusterability
    computing.

    Model selection remains a challenge in machine learning field. In clustering, the
    problem will become the selection of the optimal $k$ clusters.  


- project: Water Price Prediction and Policy design

  image_pos: "right"
  description: |
    This project is cooperated with the Ministry of Water Resources. It tends to take
    advantage of machine learning techniques to help the users and policy designers to 
    have a clear expectation of future water price. 

    Water trading is a special economic event, the price of water could vary largely 
    based on region, season, using purpose or even buyer and seller's current condition.
    Traditional methods for water trading price prediction have their own limitations.
    Many non-linear correlations between different factors require more heuristic algorithms
    to enhance the prediction quality. This project aims to adopt or design some proper
    ML algorithms to have a better seasonal preiction and could also reveal the relationship and
    importance of different attributes.

    This project is a cooperation with Antai College of Economy and Management, 
    Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

    The big spender or "Whales" is usually the main revenue of a platform. The loss
    of such customers will significantly reduce the cash flow of host platform. The

#     MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven
#     valuable for exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational
#     problem. In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic
#     traits of prospective solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits
#     and maintains only the most fit organism found with those traits. The resulting map
#     of trait combinations allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each
#     trait relates to fitness and how traits interact.

#     If we define a MAP-Elites map with traits associated with different aspects
#     of our genetic programming representation (*e.g.*, functions, program length, *etc*.),
#     we can use MAP-Elites as a tool to explore how different aspects of different
#     representations interact across different problems. Are there trade-offs
#     between different aspects of our representation? Are there parts of representation-space
#     that are unlikely to yield solutions? Exploring our GP representations in this
#     way may inform how we configure things such as variation/mutation or selection operators.

#     This project is an ongoing collaboration with fellow devolab student, [Emily Dolson](http://emilyldolson.com).
