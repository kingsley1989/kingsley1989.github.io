  description: |
    CLustering tendency is always an important issue for the community Kleinberg's 
    impossibility theorem poses diffcult problems for users. The increasing needs of
    clustering massive datasets and the high cost of running clustering algorithms 
    prompt the requirements to determine if a data set is clusterable before users 
    running the clustering algorithm on the dataset. To detect whether a dataset has 
    a cluster structure or is clusterable, that is, it may be partitioned efficiently 
    into well-differentiated groups containing similar objects. we have to looking for
    a proper way to measure the closeness between the original distance space and it's 
    corresponding benchmark space that is "most" clusterable. 

    In this project, we approach data clusterability from an ultrametric-based perspective.
    A novel approach to determine the ultrametricity of a dataset is proposed via a 
    special type of matrix product, which allows us to evaluate the clusterability 
    of the dataset. Furthermore, we show that by applying our technique to a dissimilarity 
    space will generate the sub-dominant ultrametric of the dissimilarity. 


- project: Ultrametricity and Hierarchical Clustering

  description: |
    Hierarchical clustering is a popular clustering algorithm since it can give the
    users an hierarchical relation between different observations, and could let users
    to choose how many clusters current dataset should have. Such algorithms, especially
    the linkage based clustering algorithms, are widely used in many domains such as 
    biology, manufacturing and psychology. However, the time complexity is the main 
    drawback of hierarchical clustering algorithms. 

    This work is a practical development of the techniques that used in the above
    project. Currently We proved that a min-max ultrametric matrix operation on arbitray 
    distance matrix could finally converged in to an ultrametric matrix. We also proved 
    that such matrix is identical to the cophnetic distance matrix from single linkage 
    hierarchical clustering algorithm. The natural of matrix-like operation intrigues 
    us to utilize GPU to accelerate the process of calculate hierarchical clustering. 
    Moreover, such GPU enhanced algorithm could also assist on the speed of clusterability
    computing.
    

- project: Unsupersived Model Selection on Dataset with Imbalanced clusters

  image_pos: "left" # bottom
  description: |
    Model selection remains a challenge in machine learning field. In clustering, the
    problem will become the selection of the optimal $k$ clusters. There plenty of methods
    on guiding how to choose the optimal $k$. However, many methods will failed if the
    dataset have an imbalanced cluster structure.  

    In this theoratical project, we try to develop a technique grounded in information
    theory for determining the “natural” number of clusters existent in a data set, 
    especially for dealing with clusterings of imbalanced data. Our approach involves 
    a bi-criteria optimization that makes use of the entropy and the cohesion of a 
    partition. 


- project: Water Price Prediction and Policy design

  image_pos: "right"
  description: |
    This project is cooperated with the Ministry of Water Resources. It tends to take
    advantage of machine learning techniques to help the users and policy designers to 
    have a clear expectation of future water price. 

    Water trading is a special economic event, the price of water could vary largely 
    based on region, season, using purpose or even buyer and seller's current condition.
    Traditional methods for water trading price prediction have their own limitations.
    Many non-linear correlations between different factors require more heuristic algorithms
    to enhance the prediction quality. This project aims to adopt or design some proper
    ML algorithms to have a better seasonal preiction and could also reveal the relationship and
    importance of different attributes.

    This project is a cooperation with Antai College of Economy and Management, 
    Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

    The big spender or "Whales" is usually the main revenue of a platform. The loss
    of such customers will significantly reduce the cash flow of host platform. The

#     MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven
#     valuable for exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational
#     problem. In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic
#     traits of prospective solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits
#     and maintains only the most fit organism found with those traits. The resulting map
#     of trait combinations allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each
#     trait relates to fitness and how traits interact.

#     If we define a MAP-Elites map with traits associated with different aspects
#     of our genetic programming representation (*e.g.*, functions, program length, *etc*.),
#     we can use MAP-Elites as a tool to explore how different aspects of different
#     representations interact across different problems. Are there trade-offs
#     between different aspects of our representation? Are there parts of representation-space
#     that are unlikely to yield solutions? Exploring our GP representations in this
#     way may inform how we configure things such as variation/mutation or selection operators.

#     This project is an ongoing collaboration with fellow devolab student, [Emily Dolson](http://emilyldolson.com).
