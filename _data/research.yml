    Due to the NP-hardness of many machine learning (ML) problems such as 
    clustering, decision tree, and neural network, one primary belief is that 
    solving ML problems to global optimality is computationally intractable. 
    Based on this, the dominant methods in practice are based on either heuristics 
    or local optimization algorithms, producing sub-optimal solutions. The other 
    specious belief for the ML community is that, in the era of big data, simple 
    models with strong interpretability (e.g., decision trees) cannot have the 
    same predictive power as black-box models. In this project, we developed a series of scalable 
    global optimization algorithms with deterministic global optimality guarantees 
    that challenges the above prevailing mindsets with the following conclusions. 
    1) With the detection of problem structure, solving large-scale ML problems 
    to global optimality is computationally feasible. 2) When the global 
    optimality is obtained, the performance of highly interpretable ML models 
    on large datasets can be substantially improved.

    Clustering tendency is always an important issue for the community. 
    Kleinberg's impossibility theorem poses diffcult problems for users. 
    The increasing need to cluster massive datasets and the high cost of 
    running clustering algorithms prompt the requirements to determine if 
    a data set is clusterable before users are running the clustering 
    algorithm on the dataset. To detect whether a dataset has a cluster 
    structure or is clusterable, that is, it may be partitioned efficiently 
    into well-differentiated groups containing similar objects. We have to 
    look for a proper way to measure the closeness between the original 
    distance space and its corresponding benchmark space that is "most" 
    clusterable.
    
    In this project, we approach data clusterability from an ultrametric-
    based perspective. A novel approach to determine the ultrametricity of 
    a dataset is proposed via a particular type of matrix product, which 
    allows us to evaluate the dataset's clusterability. Furthermore, we 
    show that applying our technique to a dissimilarity space will generate 
    the sub-dominant ultrametric of the dissimilarity. 


- project: Ultrametricity and Hierarchical Clustering
  image: "/imgs/ultrahierchy.jpg"
  image_pos: "right"
  description: |
    Hierarchical clustering is a popular clustering algorithm since it can 
    give the users a hierarchical relation between different observations 
    and let users choose how many clusters the current dataset should have. 
    Such algorithms, especially the linkage based clustering algorithms, 
    are widely used in many domains such as biology, manufacturing, and 
    psychology. However, the time complexity is the main drawback of 
    hierarchical clustering algorithms.
    
    This work is a practical development of the techniques used in the 
    above project. Currently, we proved that a min-max ultrametric matrix 
    operation on an arbitrary distance matrix could finally converge into 
    an ultrametric matrix. We also proved that such a matrix is identical 
    to the cophenetic distance matrix from the single-linkage hierarchical 
    clustering algorithm. The nature of matrix-like operation intrigues us 
    to utilize GPU to accelerate the process of calculating hierarchical 
    clustering. Moreover, such a GPU-enhanced algorithm could also assist 
    in the speed of clusterability computing.
    

- project: Unsupersived Model Selection on Dataset with Imbalanced clusters
  image: "/imgs/betaFuncBehv.jpeg"
  image_pos: "left" # bottom
  description: |
    Model selection remains a challenge in the machine learning field. In 
    clustering, the problem will become the selection of the optimal k 
    clusters. There are plenty of methods of guiding how to choose k. 
    However, most of them will fail if the dataset has an imbalanced 
    cluster structure.
    
    In this theoretical project, we try to develop a technique grounded in 
    information theory for determining the “natural” number of clusters 
    existent in a data set, especially for dealing with clusterings of 
    imbalanced data. Our approach involves a bi-criteria optimization that 
    makes use of the entropy and the cohesion of a partition.


- project: Water Price Prediction and Policy design
  image: "/imgs/water.jpg"
  image_pos: "right"
  description: |
    This project cooperates with the Ministry of Water Resources. It tends 
    to take advantage of machine learning techniques to help the users and 
    policy designers to have a clear expectation of future water prices.
    
    Water trading is a special economic event. The price of water could 
    vary primarily based on region, season, using purpose, or even buyer 
    and seller's current condition. Traditional methods for water trading 
    price prediction have their limitations. Specifically, many non-linear 
    correlations between different factors require more heuristic 
    algorithms to enhance the prediction quality. This project aims to 
    adopt or design some proper ML algorithms to have a better seasonal 
    prediction and could also reveal the relationship and importance of 
    different attributes.


#- project: The Loss Prediction of "Whales" on Live Streaming Platform

#  image_pos: "left" # bottom
#  description: |
#    This project is a cooperation with Antai College of Economy and 
#    Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. It aims to design a 
#    specified machine learning model to predict the loss of “whales” of a 
#    live streaming online platform and further provide the pivot factors 
#    that influence the leaving of those high-value spenders.
#    
#    The “Whales” usually refers to users who spend much money on online 
#    platforms, and the income from them could be the primary revenue of 
#    the platforms. The loss of such customers will significantly reduce 
#    the cash flow of the host platform. In recent years, the customers at 
#    the online platform reveal more interesting purchasing behaviors on 
#    virtual properties. Although platform owners gathered numerous data 
#    from their users, instantaneity and interpretability remain practical 
#    problems.

#     MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven
#     valuable for exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational
#     problem. In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic
#     traits of prospective solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits
#     and maintains only the most fit organism found with those traits. The resulting map
#     of trait combinations allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each
#     trait relates to fitness and how traits interact.

#     If we define a MAP-Elites map with traits associated with different aspects
#     of our genetic programming representation (*e.g.*, functions, program length, *etc*.),
#     we can use MAP-Elites as a tool to explore how different aspects of different
#     representations interact across different problems. Are there trade-offs
#     between different aspects of our representation? Are there parts of representation-space
#     that are unlikely to yield solutions? Exploring our GP representations in this
#     way may inform how we configure things such as variation/mutation or selection operators.

#     This project is an ongoing collaboration with fellow devolab student, [Emily Dolson](http://emilyldolson.com).
