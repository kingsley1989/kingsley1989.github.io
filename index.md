about_me: |
  I will join University of South Florida, Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering in Fall 2023 as an Assistant Professor.
  
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow affiliated to the [Institute of Applied Mathematics](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/) and [Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering](https://www.chbe.ubc.ca), University of British Columbia, under the supervision of [Yankai Cao](https://optimal.chbe.ubc.ca) .
  
  My research focuses on the use of **clusterability and deterministic global optimization** tools to address challenges when building scalable trustworthy machine learning systems. In collaboration with industrial and experimental research groups, I am using my algorithms in a wide range of applications, including neural network modularity, federated learning, biomass and biorefinery processes, neural decoding of the brain, and business decision-making. I have developed several open-source software products (with shared or distributed memory) for the community.

  I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.umb.edu) from University of Massachusetts, Boston, under the supervision of [Dan A. Simovici](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~dsim/). Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. (Master of Engineering) degree in Systems Engineering (Power System track) from Cornell University and a B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
  
  As a machine learning researcher, I enjoy applying new technologies to solve real-life problems. I also enjoy traveling and playing guitar during my spare time.
