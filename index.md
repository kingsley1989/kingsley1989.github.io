  Update: I currently joined Professor [Yankai Cao's group](https://optimal.chbe.ubc.ca) as a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering](https://www.chbe.ubc.ca), University of British Columbia.

  I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.umb.edu) from University of Massachusetts, Boston in 2016 and 2019, respectively, under the supervision of [Dan A. Simovici](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~dsim/). Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. (Master of Engineering) degree in Systems Engineering (Power System track) from Cornell University in 2013, and I also earned my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2012.
  
  My research interests lie in the theory of clustering, clusterability, and information theory-based machine learning. I also have interests in applying machine learning techniques in renewable energy and power system analysis.
  
  As a machine learning researcher, I enjoy applying new technologies to solve real-life problems. Here are some projects that I created for the convenience of myself and my family. I also enjoy traveling and astrophotography during my sparse time.
