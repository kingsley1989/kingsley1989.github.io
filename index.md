about_me: |
  I am currently a self-employed researchers located in Vancouver, Canada. I obtained my PhD degree from [UMass Boston](http://www.umb.edu) in the department of [Computer Science](http://www.cs.umb.edu). My PhD advisor is [Dan A. Simovici](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~dsim/). My research topic mainly focuses on clustering and clusterability theory. 

  As a computer scientist, I am awed by the diverse array of algorithms encoded in biological organisms. Our genomes are filled with algorithms capable of fantastic feats, such as cellular homeostasis, multicellular development, and even human intelligence. Traditionally in computer science, algorithms are designed by humans from conception to implementation, yet the capabilities of human-engineered algorithms often pale in comparison to biological organisms. 
  Broadly, my research focuses on the interplay between computer science and evolution:
  How does evolution produce the complex traits and behaviors we see in natural organisms? 
  And, how can we harness our understanding of natural evolution *in silico* to evolve
  computer programs as capable as biological organisms? 
  
  I enjoy traveling and astrophotography during my sparse time.
