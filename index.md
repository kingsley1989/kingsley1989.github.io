about_me: |
  I currently joined Professor [Yankai Cao's group](https://optimal.chbe.ubc.ca) as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Institute of Applied Mathematics](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/) and [Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering](https://www.chbe.ubc.ca), University of British Columbia.

  I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.umb.edu) from University of Massachusetts, Boston in 2016 and 2019, respectively, under the supervision of [Dan A. Simovici](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~dsim/). Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. (Master of Engineering) degree in Systems Engineering (Power System track) from Cornell University in 2013, and I also earned my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2012.
  
  My research focuses on the use of clusterability and deterministic global optimization tools to address challenges when building scalable trustworthy machine learning systems. In collaboration with industrial and experimental research groups, I am using my algorithms in a wide range of applications, including neural network modularity, federated learning, biomass and biorefinery processes, neural decoding of the brain, and business decision-making. I have developed several open-source software products (with shared or distributed memory) for the community.
  
  As a machine learning researcher, I enjoy applying new technologies to solve real-life problems. I also enjoy traveling and astrophotography during my spare time.

  *I am on 2023 academic job market!*
