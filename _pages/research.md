    "The purpose of science is to find meaningful simplicity in the midst of disorderly complexity" --- [Herbert Simon](https://www.cmu.edu/simon/what-is-simon/herbert-a-simon.html).

overview: |
    My research focus on using the clusterability and deterministic global optimization tools to address challenges when building scalable trustworthy machine learning systems.  
    
 #   With the collaboration with industrial and academical partners, fundamental machine learning algorithms, I was also involved in several practical projects that span in different domains. Currently, I entered some projects that utilize ML for management system design. These management systems also lie in various fields such as medical care, live streaming platform, water resource, and power system.
    
    Below are some of my current research projects. If anything is of interest to you, feel free to [contact me](#contact-me)!
