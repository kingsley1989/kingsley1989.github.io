overview: |
    My research initially focuses on the fundamental theory of clustering or clusterability and the design of entropy based machine learning algorithm. However, I always consider a good machine learning algorithm should generated from real life problems. During my PhD study, Besides the designing of fundamental machine learning algorithms, I also involved into several practical projects which span in different domains. Currently, I am entered some projects that utilize ML for management system design. These management systems also lie in different fields such as medical care, live streaming platform and power system.
    
    Below are some of my current research projects. If anything is of interest to you, feel free to [contact me](#contact-me)!
