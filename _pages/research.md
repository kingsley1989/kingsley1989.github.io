    "The purpose of science is to find meaningful simplicity in the midst of disorderly complexity" --- [Herbert Simon](https://www.cmu.edu/simon/what-is-simon/herbert-a-simon.html).

overview: |
    My research focus on using the clusterability and deterministic global optimization tools to address challenges when building scalable trustworthy machine learning systems. In collaboration with industrial and academical partners, I am also involved in several practical projects that span in different domains, including neural network modularity, federated learning, biomass and biorefinery processes, neural decoding of the brain, water resource, management of batter systems, and business decision-making.
    
    Below are some of my current research projects. If anything is of interest to you, feel free to [contact me](#contact-me)!
